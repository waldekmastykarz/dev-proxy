/// </item>
/// <item>
/// <b>Content-Length / Transfer-Encoding.</b> After a plugin mutates a body the

/// exactly one framing mechanism is present — never both, to avoid request smuggling.
/// </item>
/// <item>
/// <b>Host.</b> The outgoing <c>Host</c> header MUST match the forwarded
/// <c>RequestUri</c> authority after any redirect/rewrite.
